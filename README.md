## Database Information ‚Ñπ

The database for this project is hosted in a separate Git repository called `JSON-server`. It contains all the necessary information and data used by the application. To set up and use the database locally, follow the instructions below.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)

### Clone the Repositories

First, clone both the main project and the `JSON-server` repository.

```sh
# Clone the main project repository
git clone <URL-of-your-main-project-repo>

# Clone the JSON-server repository
git clone <URL-of-your-JSON-server-repo>
```

### Setting Up the Database

1. Navigate to the `JSON-server` repository directory.

```sh
cd JSON-server
```

2. Install the required dependencies.

```sh
npm install
```

3. Start the JSON server.

```sh
npm start
```

This will start the server, typically running at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Running the Project Locally

1. Navigate to the main project directory.

```sh
cd <main-project-directory>
```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser to view the project locally.
