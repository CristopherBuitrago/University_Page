# Javascript - project 📽️

The database is in this same git but in another repository called `JSON-server`. There you can find all the related information. ℹ

## If you want to see the page without the database 👀

The link is this my friend: **https://cristopherbuitrago.github.io/Javascript---Project/**

Happy review 🏆
